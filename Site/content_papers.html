	<blockquote>
		We present a new approach to ensemble learning for risk prognosis in heterogeneous medical
		populations. Our aim is to improve overall prognosis by focusing on under-represented
		patient subgroups with an atypical disease presentation; with current prognostic tools,
		these subgroups are being consistently mis-estimated. Our method proceeds sequentially by
		learning nonparametric survival estimators which iteratively learn to improve predictions
		of previously misdiagnosed patients - a process called boosting. This results in fully
		nonparametric survival estimates, that is, constrained neither by assumptions regarding
		the baseline hazard nor assumptions regarding the underlying covariate interactions - and
		thus differentiating our approach from existing boosting methods for survival analysis.

	</h4>
	<blockquote>
		We study the problem of personalizing survival estimates of patients in heterogeneous populations for clinical decision support. The desiderata are to improve predictions by making them personalized to the patient-at-hand, to better understand diseases and their risk factors, and to provide interpretable model outputs to clinicians. To enable accurate survival prognosis in heterogeneous populations we propose a novel probabilistic survival model which flexibly captures individual traits through a hierarchical latent variable formulation. Survival paths are estimated by jointly sampling the location and shape of the individual survival distribution resulting in patient-specific curves with quantifiable uncertainty estimates. An understanding of model predictions is paramount in medical practice where decisions have major social consequences. We develop a "personalized interpreter" that can be used to test the effect of covariates on each individual patient, in contrast to traditional methods that focus on population average effects. We extensively validated the proposed approach in various clinical settings, with a special focus on cardiovascular disease.

	</h4>
	<blockquote>
		Many chronic diseases possess a shared biology. Therapies designed for patients at risk of multiple diseases need to account for the shared impact they may have on related diseases to ensure maximum overall well-being. Learning from data in this setting differs from classical survival analysis methods since the incidence of an event of interest may be obscured by other related competing events. We develop a semi-parametric Bayesian regression model for survival analysis with competing risks, which can be used for jointly assessing a patient’s risk of multiple (competing) adverse outcomes. We construct a Hierarchical Bayesian Mixture (HBM) model to describe survival paths in which a patient’s covariates influence both the estimation of the type of adverse event and the subsequent survival trajectory through Multivariate Random Forests. In addition variable importance measures, which are essential for clinical interpretability are induced naturally by our model. We aim with this setting to provide accurate individual estimates but also interpretable conclusions for use as a clinical decision support tool. We compare our method with various state-of-the-art benchmarks on both synthetic and clinical data.
